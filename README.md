# Rock Paper Scissors | Game

This is a vanilla JavaScript game of the well-known [rock, paper, and scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

**[`Demo Here`](https://oliver-ard.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)ðŸ‘‹**

<u>The project had two parts</u>:

1. In the first part I created the game that is played just in the browser console.
2. In the second part I added the GUI for the game.

<u>What I have practiced in this project?</u>

- how to keep the code organized and structure the functions
- conditionals statements
- DOM manipulation
- events handling
- working with git branches (the GUI was made on a feature branch then merged with the main branch)
